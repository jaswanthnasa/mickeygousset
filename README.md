### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Mickey Gousset](http://mickeygousset.com/), a DevOps Architect on the GitHub DevOps FastTrack team.  I'm also a geek, father, speaker, writer, and singer.

And no, DevOps is not actually magic. Here is a great definition (Thanks [Donovan Brown!](https://twitter.com/DonovanBrown)):

For my day job, and as a community member, I go around and help people get more "devopsy".  I'm always happy to answer questions or try and point you in the right direction, so if you have any DevOps questions for me, hit up my contact information below and reach out. Don't be a stranger!
